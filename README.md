# **What is this Project?**

Simple demonstration of what I can do with python libraries beautiful soup and Pandas. I used beautiful soup to web scrape quotes and author’s name from a website called "[Quotes to Scrape](https://quotes.toscrape.com/)". Then I made it so the user can chose to take all the data that been collected to store it in a text file, excel sheet, JSON file, or display data in the console.

# Why did I make it?

When I learned about the things you can do with python libraries like web scraping I had to try it out. I was very excited and amazed by what I could do with Python and its external libraries. It made programming fun again and I know that Pandas and many other Python Libraries are used heavily in the industry and it would be a goop Idea to familiar my self with some of the most used Python libraries in the industry.

# What did I learn?

- I learned about the basics of how to use External Python Libraries.
- I learned about the basics of beautiful soup, Pandas, and web scraping.
- Learned about the possibilities of using python with web development and how it connects with web development.
- Python is amazing and I love it!
